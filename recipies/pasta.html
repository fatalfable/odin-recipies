    <h2>Your standard pasta</h2>

    <p>I needed a third recipe so here we are. This is store bought pasta with store bought sauce. Much like our pizza recipe, its very authentic.</p>

    <p>If you still want to make this instead of yiyo burgers then fine, but your wrong.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>store bought pasta</li>
        <li>store bought sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil water. Seriously.</li>
        <li>Heat sauce in seperate pan.</li>
        <li>Put pasta in boiling water for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove pasta and sauce and place in bowl.</li>
        <li>Thats it. what else do you want? meat? ok cook meat... put in bowl. Dumb easy. Go make a yiyo burger.</li>
