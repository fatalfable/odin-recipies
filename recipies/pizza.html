    <h2>A standard pizza with pepperoni</h2>

    <p>These are my steps to make a no fuss pepperoni pizza. It can be made to any size and any toppings can be added. You can even skip every step. Its not real anyway. Its bread, cheese, and sauce how can you mess it up? You have issues.</p>

    <p>More words about the pizza. Authentic italian I swear. straight from Italy. Maybe. Is this paragraph long enough?</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Dough (not cash money)</li>
        <li>Sauce</li>
        <li>Cheese (Prefferably mozzarella you heathen)</li>
        <li>Pepperoni</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Get your dough and turn it into a circle. I dont care how. If it looks like a rectangle, guess what? It will still cook fine.</li>
        <li>Once you have your circle, square, dodecahedron, or whatever, cover that bad boy in sauce. I mean really drizz all over it. Make it look lika a murder just occured on your dough.</li>
        <li>After the murder, drop cheese on that thing like its twerking on a pole. Make it rain! Theres not enough cheese in this world.</li>
        <li>Chuck pepperoni on it like a ninja throwing stars. It adds flavor if you make ninja noises when you do it. Is that racists? baby, you cant taste racism! Clerks 2 was funny.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees and cook for 20-25 minutes on center oven rack.</li>
    </ol>
